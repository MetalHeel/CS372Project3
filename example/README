All I did was keep the exact same code and I found some code online and
replaced only the following:

	ULT.c
	ULT.h
	parseUcontext.c

Then ran ./doTest and it went through the whole thing. Everything runs
correctly.

I don't want to copy this by any means, but to just hopefully use it for
some ideas since we're stuck so freakin hard.
